The sequencer works as is. I would like to find a way to combine the note arrays
into one single 2d array and remove the sequencerMatrix entirely.

currently there is a single sampler object that is used to play the sample sounds
over 3 Sequence objects. There is a way to combine these into a single Sequence
object, but it will take some additional HTML that I think shaun has on his sequence branch.


-- An observation on the length of sampled sounds in the sequencer --

The constructor of a Sequence object in Tonejs is as follows.
  new Tone.Sequence(a,b,c)

  a = callback function
  b = array of notes
  c = time signature of notes

  the sequence object will step through the array of notes b and play audio file
  associated with that note at time interval c regardless even if the previous audio
  file has finished playing. Over time this will cause a build up that will
  degrade the sound quality after few loops of the sequencer have completed.

  The quick solution is to limit sounds intended for the sequencer to a standard
  time constraint. Based on the samples that are associated with the sequencer now
  I think sequencer bound audio files should be 1 second or less in length.
